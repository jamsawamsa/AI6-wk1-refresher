    "[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is an excellent 2D and 3D graphics library for generating scientific figures. Some of the many advantages of this library include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Easy to get started\n",
    "* Support for $\\LaTeX$ formatted labels and texts\n",
    "* Great control of every element in a figure, including figure size and DPI. \n",
    "* High-quality output in many formats, including PNG, PDF, SVG, EPS, and PGF.\n",
    "* GUI for interactively exploring figures *and* support for headless generation of figure files (useful for batch jobs).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key features of matplotlib that makes matplotlib highly suitable for generating figures for scientific publications is that all aspects of the figure can be controlled *programmatically*. This is important for reproducibility and convenient when one needs to regenerate the figure with updated data or change its appearance. \n",

These contain the ticks, tick locations, labels, etc.  In this tutorial, we'll mostly control ticks, tick labels, and data limits through other mechanisms, so we won't touch the individual ``Axis`` part of things all that much.
