    "A computer's purpose is to stores (and manipulate) a sequence of instructions, and has a set of elements that will execute any instruction in that sequence. Once we program using instructions and data objects at the level of the machine (e.g., move 64 bits of data from this location to that location) then we do **low-level programming**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we program using more _abstract_ operations (e.g., pop up a menu on the screen) that have been provided by the language designer then we do **high-level programming**. Since you don't have to tell Python how to move bits and bytes around, when you write you are doing something abstract - your computer understands something else.\n",

    "The Python _interpreter_ is a program that interprets the programs that we write in Python by running a program that a computer understands directly. The language that your computers understand directly is called *binary*. Python is a **language**, not a program in itself, although the _interpreter_ is.  \n",
